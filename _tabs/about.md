Hi, I’m **Ting Chun (David) Liu** — I hold a **B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University (NTUEE)**.

I am passionate about the intersection of **Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Biomedical Engineering**, especially in applying **AI and data-driven methods** to solve challenges in healthcare and biotechnology.  

My current interests include:
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning** (diffusion models, transformers, video understanding)  
- **Biomedical Applications** (AI for clinical diagnosis, lab automation, bioinformatics)  
- **System Design & Engineering** (GPU computing, large-scale training, software-hardware integration)  

I am preparing for graduate study in the U.S. and actively building projects that bridge **engineering, AI, and life sciences**.  

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring creative design, building personal websites, and finding ways to connect technical work with **real-world impact**.
